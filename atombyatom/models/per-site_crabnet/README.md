# Compositionally-Restricted Attention-Based Network (CrabNet)

This software package implements the Compositionally-Restricted Attention-Based Network (CrabNet) that takes only composition information to predict material properties. The original code for CrabNet can be found at https://github.com/anthony-wang/CrabNet/tree/master. Large portions of this package are also lifted from the per-site CGCNN package (see per-site_cgcnn READme for more details).
